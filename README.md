## `WCS - Quest- React State`

---

Wild Code School quest with react.js

#### *Goal:*

Add a state to the App component, with a working property (boolean) indicating if Homer is working (true) or if he is taking a break (false).

Add a button enabling you to modify the value of working in the state.

According to the value, start or stop the atom symbol animation (React logo). In order to do this, you can simply add another css class under App-logo in App.css, for example App-logo-stop.

Optional: instead of stopping the animation, try changing it when you click the button i.e. replace transform: rotate(...) with transform: scale(...).


#### *Validation criteria:*

1. There is a button to change the App state

2. Display result depending on the state
